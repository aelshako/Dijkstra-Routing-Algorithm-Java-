# Dijkstra Routing Algorithm(programmed in Java)
Implementation of Dijkstra's routing algorithm in Java with good use of compartmentalization principles. Graphs are read in as a text file and the resultant path between two nodes is displayed on the console. Extensive testing has taken place to verify the functionality of the program. Please view the end of the documentation file to see the map used and sample output.

I've also implemented _[Dijkstra's algorithm in C](https://github.com/aelshako/Dijkstra-Routing-Algorithm-C-)._
